[`create-react-native-dapp`](https://github.com/cawfree/create-react-native-dapp) is an `npx` utility to help quickly bootstrap [**React Native ⚛️**](https://reactnative.dev) applications with access to the [**Ethereum**](https://ethereum.org) Blockchain.

Our goal is to help create a sustainable open source ecosystem for [`Web3`](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/) in React Native by providing a dependable common runtime which we can _build_ upon and extend **together**.

Watch us shill `create-react-native-dapp` [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1_37f9cseQ).

## To get started,

First, [please make sure](https://forums.expo.io/t/newly-created-app-crashes-on-ios-sim/45566) you've logged into [`expo-cli`](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/expo-cli/).
