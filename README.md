[`create-react-native-dapp`](https://github.com/cawfree/create-react-native-dapp) is an `npx` utility to help quickly bootstrap [**React Native ⚛️**](https://reactnative.dev) applications with access to the [**Ethereum**](https://ethereum.org) Blockchain.

Our goal is to help create a sustainable open source ecosystem for [`Web3`](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/) in React Native by providing a dependable common runtime which we can _buidl_ upon and extend **together**.
